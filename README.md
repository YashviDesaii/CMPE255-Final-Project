In this project, we aim to predict the PUBG game’s players winning percentage by analyzing the
game data collected over the years. We also plan to understand the relationship among the
features and analyze the data to find important features so that the dimensionality of the data can
be reduced. This strategy will also help us in determining and recommending winning strategies.
The goal is to predict the final placement of the players based on their in-game stats and initial
ratings. Additionally, we will conduct exploratory data analysis to comprehend the relationships
between the variables and determine which features are most crucial for determining how the
game will turn out.

To help players improve their chances of winning and improve their game, the project intends to
offer insights into most effective winning strategies, like whether it is advisable to hide or be
aggressive. By looking at the data, we can spot the trends that help players win and give advice
on what they should do depending on the situation. Our solution incorporates data mining
techniques such as dimensionality reduction and regression.
